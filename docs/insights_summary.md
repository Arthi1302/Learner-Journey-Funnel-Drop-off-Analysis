# Insights Summary

This section summarizes key analytical insights derived from the learner engagement dashboard. Each insight is aligned with a specific business question.

---

## 1. Learner Engagement Funnel Overview

- A significant drop-off occurs between enrollment and course start, indicating early disengagement after sign-up.
- Mid-course progression (25%–75%) shows gradual but consistent attrition, suggesting content pacing or motivation challenges.
- Only a subset of enrolled learners reach full completion, highlighting the need for targeted retention strategies.


## 2. Learner Segmentation Insights

- Casual learners form the majority of enrollments but also account for the highest number of non-completions.
- Power learners demonstrate higher completion consistency despite lower overall volume.
- Learning pace analysis shows that binge learners are more likely to complete courses compared to slow-paced learners.


## 3. Assessment Impact on Completion

- Learners who complete courses tend to have slightly higher average assessment scores than non-completers.
- Non-completers attempt assessments marginally more times on average, indicating possible difficulty or repeated failures.
- Assessment performance appears to influence persistence, but is not the sole driver of completion.


## 4. Time Investment & Engagement Depth

- Completed learners generally spend more time engaging with course content compared to non-completers.
- Scatter analysis shows diminishing returns beyond a certain time investment, suggesting over-effort does not always translate to success.
- High-engagement non-completers indicate potential friction unrelated to effort, such as content clarity or assessment difficulty.
